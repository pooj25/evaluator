---

### **SLIDE 6: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
```
How It Works

1. INPUT
   → Student uploads image or types text

2. OCR PROCESSING
   → Extract text (with blur handling)

3. TEXT NORMALIZATION
   → Clean and prepare text

4. SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
   → Use transformer model to analyze

5. RUBRIC EVALUATION
   → Score against criteria

6. FEEDBACK GENERATION
   → Generate comprehensive feedback

7. STORAGE
   → Save to database
```

---

### **SLIDE 7: ADVANCED OCR**
```
Advanced OCR for Blurry Images

PROBLEM
→ Blurry images lead to poor text extraction

SOLUTION
→ Multi-stage preprocessing pipeline
  • Image upscaling (2x-3x resolution)
  • Deblurring with sharpening filters
  • Contrast enhancement (CLAHE)
  • Adaptive thresholding

RESULT
→ Improved accuracy even for low-quality images
```

---

### **SLIDE 8: AI EVALUATION ENGINE**
```
Intelligent Evaluation System

🧠 Transformer Model
   → Pre-trained Sentence Transformers

📊 Semantic Similarity
   → Analyzes meaning, not just keywords
